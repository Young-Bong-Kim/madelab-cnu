        Our mission is to improve the efficiency of ML algorithms to next levels, to achieve non-trivial algorithms for data-intensive problems, and to develop a more parameter-efficient and robust reasoning methodology compared to existing approaches. We are passionate about tackling significant challenges in various fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on addressing fundamental problems. We are seeking talented students to join us on our journey.
