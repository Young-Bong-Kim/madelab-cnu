One of fundamental topics for artificial intelligence is the efficiency of a neural network. This topic includes how to compress a neural network with a minimal loss of accuracy, how to find an efficient model for a target environment, and how to effectively train a neural network model with a small number of data items. Due to the importance of this topic, there are lots of related works. Our lab focuses on pursuing automatic tools for model compression and a better layer-level topology for efficient neural networks. In addition, we have a great interest in defining a model's capabilities and compressing a model with keeping selected capabilities.
