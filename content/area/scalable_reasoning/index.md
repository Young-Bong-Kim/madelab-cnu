Neural reasoning is a research field of answering a question based on neural networks. Due to the great success of LLMs, recent reasoning techniques are mostly based on LLMs for factual decision. Similarly, we focus on how to make LLMs cooperate with various external data like text and large-scale knowledge graphs. Especially, we are devising an effective way of providing information to LLMs an making them generate answers from the external data with high priority. This technique would be essentail for reducing hallucination which hinder a model's ability for getting accurate answers. For reference, we are solving this problem in context of visual question anwering and commonsense-based QA.
