Neural reasoning is a research field of answering a question based on neural networks. Due to the great success of LLMs, recent reasoning techniques are mostly based on LLMs for factual decision. Similarly, we focus on how to make LLMs cooperate with various external data like text and large-scale knowledge graphs. We are solving this problem in context of visual question anwering and commonsense-based QA.
