Graph is a very useful data structure for representing various types of structual data like social networks, road networks, computer networks, and neural networks. There are lots of problems and algorithms working with it. Our lab focuses on a neural approach for solving a combinatorial optimization (graph) problem, graph data algorithms like shortest path computation, and graph neural networks with high accuracy or heterogenous nodes. We like to design non-trivial graph algorithms with real-world graph data.
